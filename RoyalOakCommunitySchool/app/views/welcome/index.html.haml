  %h2 Introducing Royal Oak Community School
  %p With the closing of Old Town Niagara-on-the-Lake's public elementary school, a committee of residents has developed Royal Oak Community School - a new, not-for-profit independent school to begin in September 2015. Royal Oak will offer elementary classes with the plans of expanding to secondary.
  %h2 Why Royal Oak Community School?
  %p Niagara-on-the-Lake is one of the most attractive communities in Canada, with a rich and proud history. Healthy vibrant communities thrive and grow in a sustainable way when they attract residents and families of many ages and backgrounds, and one of the most important ways in which they do this is by providing core community facilities - including schools. The opening of Royal Oak in September 2015 ensures that all Niagara-on-the-Lake communities will continue to have schools that serve the community, our children - and our future. This new community school will provide all residents of the broader NOTL access to excellent education designed to meet the needs of our unique town.
